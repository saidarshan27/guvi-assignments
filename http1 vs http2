Objects in JavaScript.

Object is a data structure which offers storage in terms of key value pairs.
Everything in JavaScript is a Object.
Objects are passed by refrence rather than pass by value like primitives like Strings, Numbers and Booleans.

Objects can be declared like this

let obj = {}

properties can be added while declaring or after declaring

while declaring 

let obj = {name:'GUVI'}

after declaring

let obj = {};
obj.name = 'GUVI'
or
obj['name'] = 'GUVI'.
