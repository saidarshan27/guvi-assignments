compare two JSON objects 

we can use Object.keys() and pass both the objects as arguement one by one.
later retrieve the array's containing keys.
Then use array.includes while traversing one array.

var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };

var keys1 = Object.keys(obj1);
var keys2 = Object.keys(obj2);

keys1.forEach(key=>{
  if(keys2.includes(key)){
     //do-something.
  }
})
